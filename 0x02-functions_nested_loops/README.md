Nested Loops: Nested loops are loops placed inside another loop. They allow performing repetitive tasks with intricate patterns or working with multidimensional arrays.

Functions: Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They modularize code, making it easier to understand, maintain, and reuse. To use a function, you need to declare and define it.

Declaration vs. Definition: A function declaration (prototype) informs the compiler about a function's signature before its implementation. A definition provides the actual implementation of the function
